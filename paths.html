		        	<p><i>The Paths we Choose</i> (abbreviated as 'TPWC') is both spectulative historical fiction and fantasy. Though its characters are wholly fictional and not entirely human,
		        	the intention is to represent peoples and cultural groups as accurately as possible, while keeping in mind that historical events in this universe are much different than that of our own.</p>
		        	
		        	<p>The story follows the crew of the <i>Voyager</i> who work for a trading company known as Atlantic Atlas. The crew consists officially of Dustin, Meridian, Martin, and (technically) Oonagh, but
		        	a young man named Hikari also travels with them. Generally speaking, the crew get along with each other well, but there are occiasional clashes- after all, it's all but inevitable
		        	when you're stuck on a ship for several weeks with nowhere else to go.</p>
