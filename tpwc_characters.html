    			<p><i>The Paths We Choose</i> has a cast of characters originating from locales all over
    			the world. Instead of being confined to one place, the story spans multiple countries and locations
    			across the planet.</p>
    			
    			<p>People within the universe of <i>The Paths We Choose</i> can be divided into four major groups,
    			as follows:</p>
    			
    			<ul>
    				<li><p><b>centaurs:</b> a person with a <i>four-legged</i> lower half resembling a land mammal.</p></li>
    				<li><p><b>pescapeds:</b> a person with a <i>four-legged</i> lower half resembling a fish or other sea creature.</p></li>
    				<li><p><b>satyrs:</b> a person with a <i>two-legged</i> lower half resembling a land mammal.</p></li>
    				<li><p><b>merfolk:</b> a person with a <i>fishlike tail</i> as a lower half rather than legs.</p></li>
    			</ul>
    			
    			<p>In terms of reproduction, centaurs and pescapeds can produce offspring. Satyrs and merfolk may also produce offspring,
    			but it is less common.</p>
